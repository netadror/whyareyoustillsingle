# Why Am I Still Single? 🤔

A humorous little web app that generates totally legitimate reasons why I'm still single! Built with React and a dash of self-deprecating humor.

## What is this? 🎯

This is a silly project that displays a sequence of "reasons" why I'm still single, and can help shut up your aunt/uncle/mother/annoying friend/random person in the supermarket from asking you for answers and making you feel like shit!
featuring:
- A profile picture that turns into a surprised cat when hovered 😺
- Sequential responses that are totally valid explanations (sort of)
- Social media links so they can ask you out
- Pink buttons because yes
